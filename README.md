#Upload data from google drive with shuffling

#K-fold cross validation - number 5 was used

I did not divided the data into training and testing because I want to see wchich fold provided the better result to determine the outcome

#LSTM model

Analyze for every fold-

-Training and validation loss

-Training and validation accuracy

-ROC curve


#CNN and LSTM model

Analyze for every fold-

-Training and validation loss

-Training and validation accuracy

-ROC curve
